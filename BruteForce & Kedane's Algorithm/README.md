Maximum Subarray Problem
---------------------------


This is an implementation of Kedane's Algorithm & Brute Force Algorithm in order to solve the maximum subarray problem using MATLAB.

The maximum subarray problem is a task to find the series of contiguous elements with the maximum sum in any given array. One of which we'll design with O(n) time and space complexity

For more information about the maximum subarray problem I highly encourage you to take a look at the official wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem  along with multiple google scholars articles like this https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066104003135


This code was compiled using GNU Octave version 7.3.0. This solution is my own implementation to the problem and the code was given as an assignment to the University of Ioannina, Department of Informatics & Telecommunications Algorithms & Complexity lesson during the academic year 2022-2023.
