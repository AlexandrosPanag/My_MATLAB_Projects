Damped Harmonic Motion Curve Fit (Declining Oscillation):
------

The equation of displacement x as a function of time t in a
simple harmonic oscillation is given by the relation:
x = A ημωt or x = A ημ(2πf t) (1)
where A is the amplitude of the oscillation and f is its frequency.
In real oscillations, there is always friction, which is often proportional to it
body speed. Then, the amplitude decays exponentially with time:
A = A0 e-Λt (2)
where A0 is the initial amplitude and Λ a constant (damping constant).
Combining equations (1) and (2), we conclude that the equation of removal
sion as a function of time in a frictional harmonic oscillation is given by
relationship:
x = A0 e-Λt ηm(2πf t) (3)

a) Make a program where the removal is graphically illustrated as a function
with time in the case of a harmonic oscillation with friction.
Use the following values:
Initial width A0 = 10
Frequency f = 2
Damping constant Λ = 0.4
Time: from 0 to 5 per 0.01
