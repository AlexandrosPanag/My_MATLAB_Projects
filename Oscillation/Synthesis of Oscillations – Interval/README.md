Synthesis of Oscillations - Interval
----------


We consider two simple harmonic oscillations, without friction, with the same amplitude A, whose displacements as a function of time t are given by the relations: x1 = A ημ(2πf1 t) (1)
x2 = A min(2πf2 t) (2)
where A is the amplitude of the oscillation and f is its frequency.
If a body performs both oscillations at the same time, then its distance is the sum of the two distances: x = x1 + x2 (3).

If the two frequencies f1 and f2 differ a little from each other, then the result of the composition of the two oscillations is a special case called dithering, and characterized by a relatively slow fluctuation of the amplitude of the combined oscillation.
a) Make a program to graphically display the displacement as a function of time x(t) in the case of the collision.
Use the following values:

Width A = 1

Frequencies f1 = 20 and f1 = 21

Time: from 0 to 6 per 0.01
