Write a program in which:
i) define two signals x1 and x2 of the same length as one-dimensional arrays of your choice,
ii) to find the maximum value of each signal,
iii) to find the signal x3 resulting as the difference of the two signals (x1-x2 if the maximum value of x1 is greater than the maximum value of x2, otherwise the opposite), and
iii) these three signals are displayed graphically, in the same figure but in two different subplots: x1 and x2 in the 1st subplot and x3 in the 2nd subplot.

This work was given to me as an academic assignment during the academic year 2021-2022 in the Lesson of Biomedical Technology [705] in the University of Ioannina Department of Informatics & Telecommunications.
